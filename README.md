# Password Security & Ethical Hacking Lab
## CYB204 Ethical Hacking - Hands-on Password Security Module

A comprehensive, beginner-friendly lab environment for teaching password security, ethical hacking principles, and professional penetration testing techniques.

---

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains all materials needed to deliver a 90-minute hands-on workshop on password security. Students will learn how passwords are stored, common attack methods, and defensive strategies - all within a safe, legal Docker environment.

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand password hashing and storage mechanisms
- Identify different hash types and their vulnerabilities
- Use industry-standard tools (John the Ripper, Hashcat, Hydra)
- Apply ethical hacking principles and legal boundaries
- Create and evaluate strong password policies
- Document findings in professional reports

---

## 👩‍🎓 For Students

### Getting Started
1. Follow the Quick Start guide above
2. Open `worksheets/student-worksheet.pdf`
3. Complete exercises in order
4. Ask for help if you get stuck!

### Lab Modules
- **Module 1 (40 min):** Password fundamentals and legal framework
- **Module 2 (60 min):** Offensive techniques and tools
- **Module 3 (40 min):** Defense strategies and reporting

### Important Rules
- ✅ **ONLY** test passwords in this lab environment
- ✅ Work with a partner if you need help
- ❌ **NEVER** test passwords on real websites
- ❌ **DO NOT** share cracked passwords outside class

### Troubleshooting
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Cannot connect to Docker" | Make sure Docker Desktop is running |
| "Command not found" | Check for typos, commands are case-sensitive |
| "No hashes cracked" | Try the simpler wordlist first: `/wordlists/basic.txt` |
| Need help? | Ask your instructor or partner |

## 🔒 Ethical & Legal Considerations

### This Lab is Legal Because:
- All testing occurs in isolated Docker containers
- No external systems are accessed
- Students own the test environment
- Educational purpose under controlled conditions

### This Would Be Illegal:
- Testing on any website without permission
- Attempting on university/company systems
- Sharing cracked passwords maliciously
- Using skills for unauthorized access

### Professional Ethics
This lab teaches skills used by:
- Penetration testers
- Security auditors
- Security researchers
- Incident responders

Always obtain written authorization before testing any system you don't own.

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Docker Issues
```bash
# Reset everything
docker-compose down -v
docker system prune -a
# Then start fresh
```

### Can't Crack Passwords
- Verify hash format is correct
- Try simpler wordlist first
- Check for extra spaces/characters
- Some hashes are meant to be uncrackable (teaching point)

### Performance Issues
- Reduce Hashcat workload
- Use John instead of Hashcat
- Close other applications
- Try cloud-based alternatives (TryHackMe)
